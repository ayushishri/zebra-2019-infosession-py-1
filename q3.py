    Question 3:
    
    Given two arrays of integers, find and return the least represented element(s) between both arrays.  Order does not matter for the resulting array.
    
    Example:
    [1, 1, 4, 4, 2, 3] and [1, 3, 2, 2] should return [4, 3]    (there are only two 4's and two 3's, but three 1's and 2's)
